## 🚀 About The Project

In the world of digital forensics, time is everything. The **Metadata Timeline Generator** is a sleek, modern desktop application designed for students, investigators, and the curious-minded. It cuts through the noise, extracting crucial metadata (creation times, modification dates, file types, etc.) and presents it in a clean, interactive, and easy-to-understand visual timeline.

Whether you're analyzing a single suspicious file or an entire folder of evidence, this tool helps you piece together the sequence of events, providing clear insights at a glance.

### Key Features:
* 📁 **Bulk Folder Analysis:** Process an entire folder of files and get an instant dashboard view with a file-type breakdown and a sortable metadata table.
* 📄 **Detailed File Timeline:** Select any single file to see a focused, horizontal timeline of its key timestamps (Created, Modified, Accessed).
* 📊 **Visual Dashboard:** An interactive pie chart helps you instantly understand the composition of files in a folder.
* 🖱️ **One-Click Operation:** No complex commands or setup. Just choose your file or folder and click "Generate."
* ✨ **Modern Interface:** A clean, Google-inspired dark theme that's easy on the eyes and a joy to use.
